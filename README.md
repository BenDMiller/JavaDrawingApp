Having two weeks to learn a new language and create a simple project, this project was for the educational purpose of learning and becoming exposed to Java.

# Future Work

- Allow the changing of brush color and size
- When the brush moves too fast, it doesn't draw a complete line, fix that
- Allow a pencil, marker, and stamp option for different brushes
- When importing pictures, import with proper color and size
- Allow zooming in and out of a canvas
